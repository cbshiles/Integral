Integral Program
=========

Lukas: I have an idea about how objects could make
the program work cooler. For it to work though, we'd need
to have the gcd as a separate function. If you could do 
that, then I'd like to show you my idea next time.

Lisp: Work on whole numbered k's  (look at whole*.lisp's in old branch)
